# Trivia game legacy code sample
Codebase obtained from https://github.com/jbrains/trivia for training purposes.

The objective of this repository is to show how to apply Golden Master and Snapshot Testing techniques.
I also used sampling and mutation testing coverage report to complete the training.

The post that this repository supports is [this one](https://www.victorgomezdejuan.com/2024/09/22/trabajar-con-codigo-legacy-con-snapshot-y-mutation-testing/). This post is inspired by J. B. Rainsberger's post https://blog.thecodewhisperer.com/permalink/surviving-legacy-code-with-golden-master-and-sampling as well as his online course https://www.jbrains.ca/training/course/surviving-legacy-code.
